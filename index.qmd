I use quantitative approaches to understand long-term patterns of species distributions, movement, population dynamics, and community assemblages. I am interested in how the marine community is responding to climate change by examining current spatio-temporal distributions and making forecasts for the future.

I am also interested in how we can adapt our fisheries management strategies and planning under a drastically changing climate.

I have also researched the behavior, ecology, and evolution of acoustic signals in animals: what sounds animals make and why do they make them. Much of this work centered around using passive acoustic monitoring tools to track speciesâ€™ movement patterns, and informed my current research.
